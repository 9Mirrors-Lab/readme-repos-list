## ‚≠ê Usage

You can create your `README.md` file with some comments, where this action will add a list of repositories:

```md
This is my fancy README

<!-- start: YOUR_STARTER -->...the list will be added here...<!-- end: YOUR_STARTER -->

Your README continues after the list
```

By default, "readme-repos-list" is the value for `YOUR_STARTER`. Then, add the workflow which runs, for example, every day:

```yaml
name: README Repos List
on:
  schedule:
    # run every day at midnight
    - cron: "0 0 * * *"
jobs:
  list:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Run readme-repos-list
        uses: DenverCoderOne/readme-repos-list@v2.0.0
        with:
          token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          query: "Octocat in:readme"
          max: 5
```

This will create a README like so:

<!-- start: readme-repos-list -->
<!-- This list is auto-generated using readme-repos-list -->
<!-- Do not edit this list manually, your changes will be overwritten -->
